# Plan-AI3 (version 3 without GA)
Plan-AI is a simple and efficient tool that generates a floor plan automatically based on user-provided width and height. Once the dimensions are given, the model arranges the rooms and layout intelligently—saving time and effort.

## Why Plan-AI?
Designing floor plans manually can be slow and repetitive.
Plan-AI speeds up the process, making it especially useful for civil engineers, architecture students, and anyone who frequently drafts building layouts.

## Key Advantages
Time-saving — instantly creates room layouts from just width and height

Easy to use — minimal inputs, clean output

Great for professionals — helpful for engineers who prepare plans regularly

Fully customizable — modify the dataset, algorithm, or room logic as needed

## How It Works
Download the code and dataset to your system.

Install dependencies.

Run the pipeline:

    python pipeline.py
or

    python3 pipeline.py
